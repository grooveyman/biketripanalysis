# Ford GoBike System Data
## by Emmanuel De-Graft


## Dataset

The dataset (Ford GoBike System Data) consist of data of 175,070 bike trips taken from the Month of February to 
March in greater San Francisco Bay area. The data include information on the type of riders (customer or subscriber),
the starting date and ending date as well as the duration of the trips which was converted to minutes. 
The dates were wrangled into day of the week and hour of the day. The age of rides were also extrapolated
from the birhtdate and the start date of the trips. After wrangling, the dataset consists of 
175,070 rows and 11 features (columns).


## Summary of Findings


During the investigation, I found out that the average duration of trips is approximately 11.74 minutes.
I observed that the start day and end day have a larger frequency on Thursday other than the other days, showing that more riders 
started on Thursday of February and more of them also completed on Thursday of March. I also observed a positive correlation
between the start hour and end hour. For the user type (subscriber or customer) and member age, I observed an increase in subscribers than customers, 
however, for duration, there is a ramps down for customers creating a larger margin. Thus, the customers took less time to complete their trips.
I observed that 90.5% of the riders were subscribers. It can be inferred that the customers had some kind of training or advantage over the subscribers. Moreso, considering the gender, I realized an uneven distribution
among the genders with Males overshadowing the Females with 74.6%. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on when rides were mostly taken by day of month and day of the week as well as the 
users who took the trips. I began by introducing the dates (day of the month, day of the week) as well as the duration.
Since the Ford GoBike dataset consist of a lot of categorical variables, I presented the distribution of the categorical variables.
First, I presented the distribution of the start day of the week followed by the start and end day of the month.
Next, I looked at the user types using a pie chart with colors to dipict the differences. I also looked at 
the member age and lastly, the average duration of trips
